{1}|最近修仙界热闹了许多，向道之人越来越多了。。。在这个破碎后的虚空里，御剑飞行是生存的基本技能。¤{1}|Recently, the world of cultivators has become more and more lively, and more and more people are seeking Daoism. . . In this shattered void, flying with a sword is an essential skill for survival.
{1}|听好口诀：“一剑自东来，万古唯一春。…… ……………”¤{1}|Listen to the mantra: 'A sword comes from the east, the everlasting spring.  ……………'
{1}|记住了吗？好好参悟一下吧！学会了御剑，就可以去找传道者学习一门适合你修炼的功法了！¤{1}|Did you memorize it? Meditate on it carefully! Once you have mastered the flying sword technique, you can seek out a mentor to learn a cultivation method that suits you!
{2}|谢过前辈。¤{2}|Thank you, Senior.
{1}|好好参悟一番，之后便去不远处的小药园中教训一下花妖幼灵吧。¤{1}|Take a good look at it, and after that, go to the small medicine garden not far away to teach the flower demon young spirit a lesson.
{1}|嗯？天赋不错，是来学习功法的吗？¤{1}|Huh? You have a good talent, are you here to learn to cultivate?
{2}|是的，前辈。¤{2}|Yes, senior.
{1}|嗯，作为修仙界的新人，就按照你的主灵根，学习这本功法吧！（说着，不知从哪儿掏出一本残破的书籍，递给了你）¤{1}|Well, as a newcomer to the world of cultivation, learn this technique according to your main root! (As he spoke, he took out a broken book from the void and handed it to you)
{1}|对了，参悟完成功法之后，学习一下斗转星移，日月更迭的小把戏吧，在黑夜中寻找天材地宝会事半功倍！¤{1}|By the way, after comprehending the technique, let's learn the little tricks of changing the Sun and Moon. Searching for treasures of heaven and earth in the dark night will be more effective with less effort!
{1}|不错啊，速度挺快。¤{1}|Not bad, your comprehension speed is quite fast.
{1}|嗯，受伤了？按V键就可进行打坐调息，恢复气血了！试试看吧¤{1}|Um, are you hurt? Press the V key to meditate and adjust your breath, and then you will restore your health! Try it.
打坐恢复¤meditate recovery
{1}|嗯，学会调息之法后，便可以寻找天地灵气汇聚之地进行修炼。¤{1}|Well, after learning the cultivation method, you can find the place where the aura of heaven and earth gathers to cultivate.
{1}|前方不远处，刚好有一处微弱的天地灵气，去试试借助天地灵气修炼吧。¤{1}|Not far happens to be a weak heaven and earth aura, try to cultivate there.
{1}|这份丹方送与你，算你击杀花妖的奖励。接下来可以去炼丹房处学习一下丹道知识了！¤{1}|This alchemy recipe is given to you as your reward for killing the flower demon. Next, you can go to the alchemy room to learn the knowledge of alchemy!
灵气修炼¤Introduction to Cultivation
{2}|吸纳天地灵气之后，身体轻盈了许多！¤{2}|After absorbing the aura of heaven and earth, the body is much lighter!
{1}|当修为达到身体承载的极限之后，便需要突破境界了！¤{1}|When the cultivation base reaches the limit of the body's capacity, it is necessary to break through the realm!
{1}|按T键突破境界，可以强行突破或者借用丹药¤{1}|Press the T key to break through the realm, you can forcibly break through or be aided by a pill
炼丹入门¤Introduction to Alchemy
{1}|材料应该带来吧！炼丹之道变化万千，成丹几率极小，但是只要能搞到正确的丹方，便非常容易了。¤{1}|You have to bring the ingredients! Many changes happen when doing alchemy, and the chance of succesfully making a pill is very small, but as long as you can get the correct alchemy recipe, it is very easy.
{1}|一元丹是练气阶段修仙者必备，材料获取容易，却能极大的提升练气阶段突破的成功几率！¤{1}|A Elementary Pill is a must-have for immortal cultivators in the Qi Condensation realm. The material is easy to obtain and it can greatly increase the success rate of breakthrough in the Qi Condensation realm!
{1}|开始炼丹前，一定要先好好参悟丹方！熟悉炼丹过程中的配方，比例，温度要求，并控制好火候，祝你炼制出极品丹药！¤{1}|Before you start alchemy, you must first understand the alchemy recipe! Familiarize yourself with the recipe, ratio, and temperature requirements in the alchemy process, and control the heat well. I wish you the best elixir!

{1}|在村子北边有一处雷竹林，那里灵气充裕，亦有很多动物居住着。¤{1}|There is a Thunder Bamboo Forest in the north of the village, where there is abundant Qi and many animals live.
{1}|只有在不断的战斗中，才能不断激发身体的潜能。若你能修炼到练气四重境界，再回来找我吧！¤{1}|Only in constant fighting can the potential of your body be stimulated. If you can cultivate to the fourth stage of Qi Condensation, come back to me again!
豹鳄潭试炼¤Baoe Pool Trial
{1}|嗯，比我预想中要快了不少，豹鳄潭附近豹傀泛滥，去清缴一下吧！¤{1}|Well, it's much faster than I expected. Leopard puppets are flooding around the Baoe lake. Go and kill them!
{2}|好的¤{2}|OK
{1}|除去了它便来找我吧，你如今修为，也勉强够格参加升仙大会了！¤{1}|Get rid of it and come to me, your current cultivation level is barely qualified to participate in the Immortal Ascension Conference!
{1}|不错，在前往升仙大会之前，去了解一下炼器之道吧！¤{1}|That's right, before going to the Immortal Ascension Conference, let's learn about the way of forging weapons!

These two basic alchemy recipes will be given to you, and becoming a master of alchemy will have many additional benefits!
{1}|以你如今修为，想在升仙大会中脱颖而出，毫无希望。¤{1}|Based on your current cultivation, it is hopeless to stand out in the Immortal Ascension Conference.
{1}|先去雷竹林历练一番吧！¤{1}|Let's go to Thunder Bamboo Forest to practice first!
{1}|炼器之道，万千气象，烈火熊熊，为锻金刚，炉火本真，无定则刚。掌握好材料品阶，类型与五行变化方可炼制出心满意足的法宝。¤{1}|The way of forging, thousands of rain, blazing fire, for the forging of diamonds, the fire is true, no fixed is rigid. Only by mastering the material grade and type, and the interaction of the five elements with it, can one be able to refine a satisfactory soul artifact.
{1}|当然，还需要些许气运。这里有一个炼器炉与基础炼器材料，拿去试试吧！¤{1}|Of course, a little luck is needed. Here is a smelting furnace and basic smelting materials, try it out!
{1}|仔细研究材料的属性，参悟其中的奥妙吧！¤{1}|Study the properties of the material carefully, and understand their mystery!
{1}|这么快就完成炼器了？看来有几分天赋。绝佳的极品法宝大多是炼器大师的手笔。¤{1}|Completed the forging so quickly? It seems you have some talent for it. Most of the best magic weapons are handcrafted by master craftsmen.
{1}|咳咳，废话有点多了。。去升仙大会看看吧！¤{1}|Ahem, a bit too much nonsense. . Go to the Immortal Ascension Conference to see it!
升仙大会报名¤Registration for Immortal Ascension Conference

{1}|在不借助飞剑情况下，跳跃到最高处凉亭，就可以了！¤{1}|Jump to the highest pavilion without the aid of a flying sword, and that's it!
{1}|失败了，可以再来找我，好好练练吧！¤{1}|If you fail, you can come to me again and practice hard!
{1}|接下来，可以进行实力考核了！¤{1}|Next, the strength assessment will be carried out!

{1}|这些材料应该会对你有所帮助，抓紧炼化一下，提升实力吧！¤{1}|These materials should be helpful to you, hurry up and refine them to improve your strength!
{1}|茫茫小世界中泛滥的妖兽还需要你去一一诛杀！¤{1}|The monsters are still flooding the vast small world. We need you to kill them one by one!
{1}|升仙大会？你先去把农田里的野猪清理一下吧！今年的收成怕是又要被糟蹋了！¤{1}|The Immortal Ascension Conference? Go clean up the wild boars in the farmland first! I'm afraid this year's harvest will be ruined again!
{2}|为什么又是我。。。¤{2}|Why me again. . .

{1}|野猪已经清理干净了呢！¤{1}|The wild boar has been cleaned up!
{2}|野猪越来越厉害了，咳!咳！咳！¤{2}|The wild boar is getting stronger and stronger, cough! Cough! cough!
{1}|嗯，年龄也差不多了，先学习一下调息之法吧！¤{1}|Well, our age is almost the same, let's learn the method of cultivation first!
打坐调息之法¤method of cultivation
{2}|经过几天调息之后，伤口竟然神奇的愈合了！¤{2}|After a few days of cultivation, the wound healed miraculously!
